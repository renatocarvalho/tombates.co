          <h1>Memex <span class="u-text--grey">is the story of an addictive side project.</span></h1>

          <p>I keep referencing this as "memex", but let's face it. It never really had a name. The project was always in such a state of flux that any alias I gave it never stuck. It's a project that has been through more iterations and processes than I can remember <span class="u-text--grey">&ndash; wireframes, visual designs, prototypes and sketches &ndash;</span> but nothing really finished. At least not finished to a state I would consider releasing to any unsuspecting victim. Yeah this sounds bad, let me explain.</p>

          <p>It all started around two years ago while I was studying at Central St Martins. At the time I was finding it difficult to document the way I was working. I wanted to find a better way of dealing with hand-ins, crits, explaining my ideas, etc. I remembered reading about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vannevar_Bush" target="_blank">Vannevar Bush</a>'s <em>Memex</em> <span class="u-text--grey">&ndash; a portmanteau of "memory" and "index" &ndash;</span> and a simple idea got it's foot in the door.</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>Bush envisioned the memex as a device in which individuals would compress and store all of their books, records, and communications, "mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility." The memex would provide an "enlarged intimate supplement to one's memory".</p>

          <p>My aim was to create a tool that allowed me to link together various types of content and create a trail of associations based upon my thought process. It would allow me to retrace my steps and figure out exactly how I got from A to Z. Essentially, it wouldn't be too disimilar from a bookmarking service such as <a href="http://kippt.com" target="_blank">Kippt</a>. However, it would attempt to move away from the usual paradigm of storing content lists and folders and into a more personal associative system. Everyone's brain creates links between content in different ways, so why stick to shoving content into rough categorical and chronological lists. It could be simpler.</p>

          <h2>The Idea</h2>

          <p>From the start, I didn't really have an idea how I was going to solve the problem. Well I knew how I wanted to attempt to do it, but I had no idea of the form it would take. I began to play around with an idea of a square grid, where you can simple drag and drop content to link it together, creating a grid based mind map. You can then follow a path outwards in various directions away from the original starting point of a project.</p>

          <p>I went through phases of building, designing in photoshop and then returning back to my sketch book to try figure things out. Below are a bunch of visuals that I posted on dribbble throughout the time I was playing with this as a concept.</p>

          <p>Ultimately, I found this project became too large a distraction from my studies and professional work. I so badly wanted it to live, but constantly found myself losing track of time spent on it and going around in circles. I should have created a better structure for myself to work from <span class="u-text--grey">&ndash; which if I revisit this, I will definitely have.</span> That sounds very bleak, but I learnt so much working on this.</p>

          <h2>Lessons learnt</h2>

          <p>So why am I including a project that never lived on my portfolio? Simple. Because I learnt more from this project than I did from any other. It gave me a chance to learn technology <span class="u-text--grey">&ndash; to name a few basic computing concepts, backbone, meteor, rails and sinatra</span>. It was great, I got to nerd out over stuff that I wouldn't have a chance to play with in my everyday work.</p>

          <p>I got to explore some really complicated interaction design problems. How do people make these links? How can I relate that on screen? What happens if someone wants to link 50 items to one piece of content? How scalable is this as a concept? What about collaborations? So many options to consider.</p>

          <p>It allowed me to look at a lot of different visual styles. It was my baby and I could decide how it was going to look, it gave me the freedom to play. I got to learn more about the little details, I had to take into account the whole picture and not just perfecting that single screen. It was the challenge that I needed.</p>

          <p>And most importantly <span class="u-text--grey">&ndash; as with all side projects &ndash;</span> it gave me an escape from my university work and professional work. Sometimes you just need to step away from it all and take some time to do something different.</p>

          <h2>Whats next?</h2>

          <p>I still want to make this happen, but I could never decide if this was something people would actually want to use. So maybe you want to tell me? Do you want to see this as a finished product? Let me know over on <a href="http://twitter.com/yoamomonstruos">Twitter</a> or just drop me an <a href="mailto:hey@tombates.co">email</a> with your thoughts. Oh and if you've made it this far you get a present.</p>
